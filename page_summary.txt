# Application Pages Summary

This document provides a concise summary of each page in the application, categorized by their intended audience (Regular Tenant/User vs. Platform Admin), along with their core functions.

## Regular User / Tenant Views

**1. Login (`/login`)**
*   **Core Function:** Allows regular users (tenants) to authenticate and access their specific workspace.

**2. Playground (`/playground`)**
*   **Core Function:** A testing environment where users can simulate chats with their trained AI agent to evaluate its responses, knowledge recall, and behavior before deploying it to actual customers.

**3. Leads / Contact Book (`/leads`)**
*   **Core Function:** Manages the CRM aspect of the application. Users can view, add, and manage customer contacts (leads), including their details and historical data.

**4. Inbox / Inbound (`/inbox`)**
*   **Core Function:** A centralized hub for viewing and responding to incoming messages from various connected channels (e.g., WhatsApp, web chat) assigned to the tenant.

**5. Agents / Teammate Profile (`/agents`)**
*   **Core Function:** The "Hire & Train" interface where users configure their AI agent(s). Users can set the system prompt, define the agent's persona/behavior, and toggle active skills (e.g., product catalog access).

**6. Knowledge (`/knowledge`)**
*   **Core Function:** Allows users to upload and manage the information the AI agent can use. Users can add text files, PDFs, and other resources that the agent can retrieve (RAG) to answer customer questions accurately.

**8. Calendar (`/calendar`)**
*   **Core Function:** Manages the user's availability and appointments. The AI agent uses this information to help schedule meetings or appointments with leads.
